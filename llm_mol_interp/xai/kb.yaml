haloarene:
  title: Halogenated aromatic (aryl halide)
  summary: >
    Halogenated aromatics can elevate AhR and stress responses via planarity, hydrophobicity,
    and metabolic stability; polyhalogenation increases risk.
  caveats:
    - Substitution pattern matters; many are benign.
    - Lipophilicity and assay artifacts can inflate signals.
  mitigation:
    - Reduce halogenation or use less lipophilic substituents.
    - Break planarity (e.g., ortho block or sp3 linker).
    - Add polarity/HBD/HBA to lower logP and nonspecific binding.

aldehyde:
  title: Reactive aldehyde
  summary: >
    Electrophilic carbonyls can form Schiff bases and trigger stress/DNA-damage pathways.
  mitigation:
    - Convert to amide/acid/isostere; add steric hindrance near the carbonyl.

azo:
  title: Azo linkage (–N=N–)
  summary: >
    Reductive cleavage can yield aromatic amines and drive p53/stress signals.
  mitigation:
    - Replace azo with a non-cleavable linker; avoid downstream anilines.

polycyclic aromatic:
  title: Polycyclic aromatic system
  summary: >
    Planar, hydrophobic polycyclics can bind AhR and promote oxidative stress.
  mitigation:
    - Reduce planarity; add heteroatoms/sp3; lower logP.
